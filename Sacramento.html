<h1>The Uneven Toll of Evictions</h1>
<p>The rate and volume of evictions in Sacramento County fell to a low point in 2016, according to data released by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab.</p>
<p>Not since the early 2000s have there been fewer eviction cases filed and evictions judgments rendered in the county. The data released in April appears to be one of the first attempts to calculate the scale of evictions nationwide. </p>
<p>Although the eviction rate is down in the county overall and the city of Sacramento, it’s a different story when you zoom in to look at some individual places. In some cases, the more impoverished a place is the higher the rate of eviction.</p>

<p>The data shows that eviction is more common in some places than others. The community of North Highlands, for example, had about 4 percent of the county’s renter-occupied households but experienced 8.5 percent of the evictions in 2016. And North Highlands only takes in about 3 percent of the county population. </p>
<p>Smaller places like Lemon Hill also experience a disproportionate share of eviction. </p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This could be written as a quick-turn story with graphics. It could also be a nice jumping off point to dive deeper into court records, interviewing renters, landlords and social service providers to learn more about why these trends exist. </p>

<h1>Homeownership on the Rise </h1>

<p>In the last two years, the Sacramento metro area saw an upsurge in the number of people taking out mortgages to buy homes. More mortgages than even before the onset of the Great Recession in 2008, according to data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>
<p>The implications of the more than 30 percent jump in activity across the metro area are significant. More homeowners are no doubt a positive for the economy. But it also places a greater burden on the area’s resources.</p>
<p>Are cities keeping up?</p>
<p>Combine this insight with a deeper analysis of the data focusing on census tract level information, deed recordings and it’s possible that gain a clearer picture of who these homebuyers are. The trend also prompts questions about whether this is new construction or previously empty homes.</p>

<h1>Are People Getting Priced Out?</h1>
<p>The real estate market recovery is also sending prices up in a once-affordable part of the state. The median list price of a home increased more than two-fold between 2012 and 2018, according to data from Realtor.com. </p>

<h1>Yet So Many People Still Come to Sacramento County</h1>
<p>The lion’s share seem to come from within the state, according to the IRS. </p> 
<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/49799"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
<p>About 70 percent of the in-state migration into Sacramento County in 2016 came from the Bay Area. </p>
